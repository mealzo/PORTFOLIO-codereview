            <p><strong>Hello!</strong> I am a musician and artist currently based out of Portland, OR. I have performed in over 1,000 venues. For the past few years I have played in a two piece band, <a href="https://calmcandy.bandcamp.com/album/how-it-feels-to-want-ep" target="_blank">Calm Candy</a>. I am working on a solo project right now called "Mealz" and hope to start performing again soon. </p>
            <p>I have also been pursuing installation and new media arts which has led me to learn programming through the arduino platform. I have created a sound interactive light installation, and I've turned my plants into a midi controller. I also enjoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZursHWKH5Y" target="_blank">making videos</a>, digital drawings, and paintings. In my spare time (if I have any) I enjoy cooking, reading tarot, and going to shows</p>

            <h2>Why I joined epicodus</h2>
            <p>For the past decade I have focused on my pursuit of art and its intersection with technology. While doing so, I have worked diligently in the restaurant industry as it has allowed me a flexible schedule that afforded me time to learn and grow as a person, artist, musician, and team player. <strong>Now</strong> I feel it is time for me to use all the tools I have been perfecting to pursue a new career path.</p>
            <p>For over a year I have been teaching myself to code, often it was out of necessity for some art project I was working on. I started with Arduino and moved on to BASIC. From there I realized I had a knack for coding and really enjoyed how it allowed me to problem solve. I became interested in Web Development because it crosses between design and coding. After taking many courses online and feeling like I had some understanding of the basics HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I realized I wanted an atmosphere where I could interface with other programmers, and stop learning in a vacuum. I chose epicodus after a lot of deliberation and comparing various coding bootcamps. Ultimately I chose Epicodus because the affordability and flexible schedule.</p>
